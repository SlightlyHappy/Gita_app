# Design Mockups Folder

This folder is organized by screen for easy reference of Google Stitch mockups.

## Folder Structure:

- **homescreen/** - Upload your Home/Chapters list mockup here
- **versesscreen/** - Upload your Verses screen mockup here
- **versedetailscreen/** - Upload your Verse Detail/Full view mockup here
- **searchfavorites/** - Upload your Search and/or Favorites screen mockups here

## How to Use:

1. Export your mockups from Google Stitch as images (PNG/JPG recommended)
2. Copy them to the appropriate folder
3. Share the folder path or image links with the AI assistant to review and implement the designs

## Notes:

- You can add screenshots, Figma links, or Stitch export files
- Multiple images per screen are welcome (e.g., light/dark modes, different states)
- High resolution images (300+ dpi) work best for detailed review
